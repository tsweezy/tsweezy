#### A bit more about me

I'm a Computer Science and Digital Studies student at Grand Valley State University and have been making digital media for nearly a decade. I have years of professional experience with the Adobe Suite and 3D art packages, experience with Java, C#, C++ HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and other languages, and an eagerness to learn.

I am extremely passionate about ways in which artistic expression is conveyed through digital media, and strive to create things with true impact through my own work.

â˜€ have a great day ðŸŒ»
